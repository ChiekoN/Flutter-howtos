
## 1. Version Number Structure:
```
CopyMajor.Minor.Patch (e.g., 1.2.3)
```

- Major: Significant changes, breaking updates
- Minor: New features with backward compatibility
- Patch: Bug fixes and minor updates

## 2. Build Number:

- Increment with each build
- Format: Unique integer (e.g., 123)
- Example combined version: 1.2.3 (123)

## 3. Version Code (Android):

- Must be unique and higher than previous versions
- Integer value
- Example in build.gradle:

```
gradleCopyandroid {
    defaultConfig {
        versionCode 123      // Build number
        versionName "1.2.3"  // User-visible version
    }
}
```

## 4. Version Name (iOS):

In Info.plist:
```
xmlCopy<key>CFBundleShortVersionString</key>
<string>1.2.3</string>    // Marketing version
<key>CFBundleVersion</key>
<string>123</string>      // Build number
```

## Best Practices:

1. Semantic Versioning Rules:

  - Major (1.0.0): Breaking changes
  - Minor (0.1.0): New features
  - Patch (0.0.1): Bug fixes


2. Pre-release Versions:

  - Alpha: 1.0.0-alpha.1
  - Beta: 1.0.0-beta.1
  - RC: 1.0.0-rc.1 (Release Candidate)


3. Git Tagging:

  - Tag each release: git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Version 1.2.3"
  - Push tags: git push --tags


4. Changelog Maintenance:

  - Document all changes
  - Group by type (Features, Fixes, etc.)
  - Include version numbers


5. Release Strategy:

  - Internal Testing → Alpha → Beta → Production
  - Each phase should have its version scheme


6. Version Control:

  - Keep development version higher than store version
  - Example: Store(1.2.3) → Dev(1.2.4-dev)


7. Store Considerations:

Google Play: Version code must increase
App Store: Both version and build number must increase


## Alpha vs Beta

### Alpha Version:

1. First testing phase after internal testing
2. Very early, unstable version
3. Usually tested internally or by a small group of developers
4. Contains major bugs and incomplete features
5. Features may be added or removed frequently
6. Not suitable for daily use
7. Typically limited to technical users who understand risks
8. May crash or have serious performance issues

### Beta Version:

1. More mature phase after alpha testing
2. More stable and feature-complete
3. Tested by a larger group of external users
4. Most major bugs are fixed
5. Feature set is mostly frozen
6. Can be used for daily tasks, with caution
7. Open to regular users who want early access
8. Performance issues are mostly resolved

### Release Flow:
Internal Testing → Alpha → Beta → Release Candidate → Production

or example, if you're releasing version 1.0.0:

- Alpha: 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-alpha.2
- Beta: 1.0.0-beta.1, 1.0.0-beta.2
- Release Candidate: 1.0.0-rc.1
- Production: 1.0.0
