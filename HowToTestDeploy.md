# Summary of testing and deployment procedures

Let's explore the testing and deployment procedures for Flutter apps.  I'll break down the key concepts and provide some helpful resources.

**Testing Flutter Apps**

Testing is crucial for ensuring the quality and stability of your Flutter applications.  Flutter provides a robust testing framework that allows you to write various types of tests:

  * **Unit Tests:** These tests verify the functionality of individual functions, methods, or classes in isolation.  They focus on the logic within a specific unit of code.  Flutter's `flutter_test` package is the primary tool for writing unit tests.

  * **Widget Tests:** Widget tests examine the UI components (widgets) and their interactions. They ensure that widgets render correctly and respond to user input as expected.  `flutter_test` also handles widget testing.

  * **Integration Tests:** Integration tests cover the interaction between multiple parts of your app or even with external services (like APIs or databases).  They verify that the different components work together seamlessly.  Flutter's `integration_test` package is used for this.

**Testing Workflow**

1.  **Write Tests:** Create test files (usually with a `_test.dart` suffix) alongside your code.  Use the `flutter_test` package's APIs to define test cases, expectations, and assertions.

2.  **Run Tests:** Execute your tests using the `flutter test` command in your terminal. Flutter will run the tests and report the results.

3.  **Analyze Results:** Review the test results to identify any failures or errors.  Fix the issues in your code and re-run the tests until they pass.

**Key Testing Concepts and Tools**

  * **`flutter_test` package:** The core package for writing unit and widget tests.  It provides functions for setting up test environments, creating mock objects, and making assertions.

  * **`integration_test` package:** Used for integration testing, allowing you to simulate user interactions and test the app as a whole.

  * **Mocking:** Creating mock objects to isolate units of code during testing and avoid dependencies on external resources.  The `mockito` package is often used for mocking in Flutter.

  * **Test Coverage:** Measuring how much of your code is covered by your tests.  Tools like `flutter test --coverage` can generate coverage reports.

  * **Continuous Integration (CI):** Integrating testing into your CI pipeline to automatically run tests whenever code changes are pushed.  This helps catch issues early.

**Deployment Procedures**

The deployment process varies depending on the target platform (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop). Here's a general overview:

**1. Build Release Version:**

  * **Android:** Use `flutter build apk` (for Android Application Package) or `flutter build appbundle` (for Android App Bundle). App bundles are the recommended way to publish on the Google Play Store.

  * **iOS:** Use `flutter build ios --release`. You'll need Xcode to manage the iOS build process and create an archive.

  * **Web:** Use `flutter build web`.

  * **Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux):** Use `flutter build windows`, `flutter build macos`, or `flutter build linux`.

**2. Platform-Specific Steps:**

  * **Android:**

      * Sign your APK or App Bundle using a keystore.
      * Upload the signed artifact to the Google Play Console.
      * Configure your app's listing, including descriptions, screenshots, and pricing.
      * Publish your app.

  * **iOS:**

      * Open the generated Xcode project.
      * Configure signing and provisioning profiles.
      * Archive the app and upload it to App Store Connect.
      * Manage your app's metadata and prepare for release.

  * **Web:**

      * Deploy the contents of the `build/web` directory to a web server (e.g., Firebase Hosting, Netlify, AWS S3).

  * **Desktop:**

      * Package the build artifacts into an installer or distributable format for each platform.
      * Distribute the installers through your chosen channels.

**3. Release Management:**

  * **Versioning:** Use semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.0.1) to track your app releases.

  * **Staged Rollouts:** Gradually release your app to a small percentage of users first to monitor for any issues before a full rollout.

  * **Crash Reporting:** Integrate crash reporting tools (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry) to capture and analyze app crashes.

  * **Monitoring:** Monitor your app's performance and usage metrics after release.

# Package installation

- About `dart pub add`: https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-add

- Adding a package dependencies to `pubspec.yaml` from commandline:
  ```
  $ dart pub add <package name e.g. http>
  ```
  This is equivalent to editing pubspec.yaml to add the `http` package, and then calling `dart pub get`.

- To add the package as a **dev** dependency,
  ```
  $ dart pub add dev:foo           # adds newest compatible stable version of foo
  $ dart pub add dev:foo:^2.0.0    # adds specified constraint of foo
  $ dart pub add foo dev:bar       # adds regular dependency foo and dev dependency bar simultaneously
  ```

## Handling errors

- When I tried to add `integration_test`, I got the error. (Do the same for `flutter_driver` as well)
  ```
  > flutter pub add integration_test --dev
  The current Dart SDK version is 3.7.0.
  Because testing_app depends on integration_test any which doesn't support null safety, version solving failed.
  The lower bound of "sdk: '>=2.2.2 <3.0.0'" must be 2.12.0 or higher to enable null safety.
  For details, see https://dart.dev/null-safety
  Failed to update packages.
  ```

  - **Solution**: Since you're using Flutter, you should use the integration_test package that comes bundled with the Flutter SDK rather than adding it as a separate dependency. 
    1. update your pubspec.yaml to reference the integration_test from the Flutter SDK:
    ```
      dev_dependencies:
        flutter_test:
          sdk: flutter
        integration_test:
          sdk: flutter
    ```

    2. Run `flutter pub get` to update your dependencies
